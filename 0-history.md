# [The History of JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sh6lK57Cuk4)
ECMAScript's evolution over the last 25 years

JavaScript started as a prototype scripting language written by [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) in 1995 for the Netscape Navigator browser under the working name of "Mocha". After being renamed to "JavaScript", it was standardized by ECMA International as [ECMA-262](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262-arch.htm), or ECMAScript in 1997. The authoritative group of people/orgs in charge of the standard is known TC-39.

Over the next 25 years, it would see a variety of highs and lows. The most notable releases include :
> * ES1 1997.
> * ES2 1998.
> * ES3 1999. The longest standing version of early JS.
> * ES4 Never finalized. 
> * ES5 2009. Added JSON, strict mode, functional array methods, and more.
> * ES6 2015. Added classes, promised, arrow functions, let/const, and much more. 
> * ES7, ES8, ES9, ESNext. Modern updates now being released annually.
